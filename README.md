archinspec is a tool to help you maintain a great architecture for your application.
You simply define how your architecture should look like and archinspec validates that it actually is as expected.
If you use domain-driven design (DDD) or the [onion architecture](http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/) this tool will help you keep your application free from architecture violations!

> **WARNING**: the tool is still in development. Anything can change anytime. Oh, and there might be some bugs here and there :-)
